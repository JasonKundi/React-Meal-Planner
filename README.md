# React-Meal-Planner

Here is an app I am making so me and my girlfriend can save half an hour everyday discussing possible dinner options

The app is fairly simple. A user can enter the amount of calories they wish to consume in a day. They can then click on the get meals button. The app then makes a fetch call to the Spoonacular api and generates 3 meals at random which roughly meets their daily calorie requirement. Depending on what meals are rendered on screen, the aily macros calculator adjusts. Next step going forward, I will program the user the ability to adjust how much protein, carbs and fat they wish to take in also. That way the meals aren't just generated on calorie count.


This app was built using React
